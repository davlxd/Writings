Inspired by ThoughtWorks [Tech Rdar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar),
I always want to create something similiar for my Web resume,
and I managed to create one as the gif shows above.

Here is a wrap-up of some of the key components and steps and tricks,
the code on Github is [here](https://github.com/lxdcn/react-d3-radar-demo),
live demo is [here](https://radar-demo.lxd.me/).


## Draw the background


## Posision blips


## Collision avoidance for the blip AND its label
